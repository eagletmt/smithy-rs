//! <p>Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
//! developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch uses the advantages of
//! this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
//! infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
//! advantages, AWS Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively
//! helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.</p>
//! <p>As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically
//! provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
//! workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
//! your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.</p>
